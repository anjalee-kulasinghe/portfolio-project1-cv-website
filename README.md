# Anjalee Kulasinghe Online CV

## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development.

This website was developed to showcase my ability to design and create a static website.

Online CV is the website that includes my experience, education, skills, and expertise, as well as my contact information. I have created this website to target the potential employment opportunities. Since online resumes are instant, I have the opportunity to update my resume with a few clicks, and the CV will be up-to-date.
