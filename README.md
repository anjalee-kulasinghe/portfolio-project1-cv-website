# Anjalee Kulasinghe Online CV

## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development.

This website was developed to showcase my ability to design and create a static website.

Online CV is the website that includes my experience, education, skills, and expertise, as well as my contact information. I have created this website to target the potential employment opportunities. Since online resumes are instant, I have the opportunity to update my resume with a few clicks, and the CV will be up-to-date.

## UX
There are two user groups targeted by this website. They are employers and the recruiters.
The site is focused on simplicity and ease of navigation for the user's main focus areas on my resume.

## User stories
As the sole developer of this website, my goal is to secure employment opportunities in the web development area as well as other potential employment in the area of IT.
I came up with the following points, which are applicable to the users:

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of this website quickly and easily.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate this website (by using a mouse, a keyboard, or a touch screen).
- As a user, I want to view this candidate's work and education history and skills.
- As a user, I want to know what technical languages and tools this candidate is able to work in, as well as the candidate's language proficiency.
- As a user, I want a way to contact this candidate.
- As a user, I want to get a copy of the candidate's traditional CV.

### Strategy
The goal is to make a well-functioning professional CV website. The focus was on making the design both user-friendly and creative.

### Scope
For the users (employers and recruiters), I wanted to give them a good overview of myself (Anjalee Kulasinghe), focusing on my experience, education, and skills. This way, the users can get a better idea of who I am and whether I am a potential candidate for the vacancy. As well, I kept the traditional CV format so it would be easy for the users to find information about me.

### Structure
I followed the traditional CV framework since it is not overly complicated and it will be easy for the users to find the information they are looking for. The Online CV website has a single, long, scrolling page design. My structure features a fixed top navigation that connects the user to each of the sections from anywhere on the page. I have also included a link at the end of the navigation to download a copy of the traditional CV if the user likes that format.

**Website Sections:
1. **__Home / Landing page:__** A simple introduction about myself.
2. **__Experience:__** My work histories are displayed in reverse chronological order.
3. **__Education:__** My education history is displayed in reverse chronological order.
4. ****Skills:**** Four focus areas are divided into boxes, which include my professional skillset, language proficiency, technical languages, and technical tools that I am familiar with.
5. **__Contact:__** A contact page featuring basic contact information, including social media links and a contact form.
6. ****Footer:**** This is not the main section of the website but rather an ending to the website with copywriting information.
